# Challenge_2

## Description

This project was done to build a responsive web portfolio. It enables people with different viewports view the webpage with no issues. The contents of the webpage modify to suit the users screensize.

This was made possible using media queries and flexbox predominantly.

Also, the webpage has a functionality that allows users to click a heading in the navigation bar which takes the user directly to a section of the webpage where more information on the webpage is loacted. This is a user interface that improves the user experience and reduces the time it will take for users to navigate to a certain part of the webpage.

The images in the work section when hovered increase in size and when clicked redirects the user to a new tab where information on the project/ work is located. Opening the page in a new tab enables the user to seamlessly navigate through the webpage and return back to where they were easily, further increasing user experience.

I have been able to learn the functionality and importance of media queries in making a website responsive for easy accessibility.
